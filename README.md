Each problem I have solved on leetcode.com will have its own folder with the naming convention 

[difficulty]\_[problem ID]\_[problem name]

Within each folder, there will be the best solution I currently have come up with, titled [problem name].java

If the problem was difficult enough to require multiple iterations, they will be called solutionX.java. For particularly difficult problems, there will be a thinking.md file with my thoughts as I iterated toward a solution.
